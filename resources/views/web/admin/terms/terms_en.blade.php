                <h2>Use of Services & Account</h2>
                <ul>
                   <li>SUIIZ may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee permits certain Content to be posted in a designated area of the Website. Each party posting Content to the Service is responsible for said Content and compliance with the Terms. Any such fees paid hereunder are non-refundable in the event any Content is removed from the Service for violating these Terms. Additional terms regarding paid Content will be fully stated in the applicable section(s).  </li>
                   <li>As used herein, the term "Posting Agent" refers to a third-party agent, service or intermediary that offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. SUIIZ prohibits the use of Posting Agents, directly or indirectly, without the express written permission of SUIIZ. In addition, Posting Agents are not permitted to post Content on behalf of others, directly or indirectly, or otherwise access the Service in order to post Content on behalf of others, except with express written permission or license from SUIIZ.    </li>
                   <li>SUIIZ grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access and use the Service for personal use. This license granted herein does not include any of the following: (a) access to or use of the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, reproduction, display or derivative use of the Service nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by SUIIZ or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file, may engage in the activities set forth in (b). For purposes of this exception, a "general purpose internet search engine" does not include a website or search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings including any subset of classifieds listings such as housing, for sale, jobs, services, or personals, or which otherwise provides classified ad listing services. The license set forth in this Section permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink thereto, individual postings on the Service so long as such use is for non-commercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in personal blogs or other personal online media). If the total number of such postings displayed on or linked to your website exceeds ninety-nine (99) postings, your use will be considered to be in violation of these Terms, unless SUIIZ expressly grants you permission otherwise. You are also permitted to create a hyperlink to the home page of the Website so long as the link does not portray SUIIZ, its employees, affiliates or agents in a false, confusing, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter. SUIIZ may offer parts of the Service in RSS format for the purpose of embedding individual RSS feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings through third party software news aggregators. SUIIZ permits you to display, excerpt from, and link to any such RSS feeds on your personal website or personal blow, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title within an RSS feed is correctly linked back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, in a conspicuous manner, proper attribution to 'SUIIZ' as the source of the RSS feed, (d) your use or display of the RSS feed does not suggest that SUIIZ promotes or endorses any third party causes, opinions, ideas, websites, products or services, (e) you do not redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden or otherwise slow the performance of SUIIZ's systems. SUIIZ reserves all rights in and to the content of any RSS feeds provided through the Service and may terminate any RSS feed at any time without notice. Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access as set forth in these Terms immediately terminates any permission or license granted herein. In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a license from SUIIZ.</li>
                   <li>Please report any violations of the Terms that you become aware of by contacting us using the link at the bottom of the SUIIZ homepage at SUIIZ.com.eg or go to our Help Center . Any failure to act by SUIIZ with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches by you or others. Notwithstanding the aforesaid clauses regarding any other provision of these Terms, SUIIZ retains the right to seek legal and equitable remedies, including without limitation, specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach or threatened breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof, without the necessity of posting a bond. </li>
